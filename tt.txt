    The Solar System consists of the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it, including eight planets, their moons, dwarf 
    planets, and countless smaller objects like asteroids and comets. The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are
    rocky, while the four outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are gas giants. The asteroid belt lies between Mars 
    and Jupiter, containing numerous asteroids and dwarf planets like Ceres. Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, home to Pluto
    and other icy bodies. The Solar System also includes the Oort Cloud, a distant spherical shell of icy objects believed to 
    be the source of long-period comets.
